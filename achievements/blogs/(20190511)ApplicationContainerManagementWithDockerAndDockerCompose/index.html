  <h2>0. Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    In the past several years, Docker has become one of the hottest technologies in the IT industry. It's quite a shame that they don't teach how to manage continuous integration/delivery in school. Since there are numerous application development frameworks that enable developers to create applications/services rapidly and efficiently by confining the way they can choose to develop functionalities, deployment process has become very important even for non-DevOps people. Especially if you are working close to the servers, it would be nice to understand how your back-end micro-services get deployed and talking to each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    Traditionally, you would manage all the dependencies on the servers to deploy an application manually. This certainly creates lots of problems including managing all the different versions of dependencies that need to be updated in a timely manner. What if one service needs a subset of dependencies while another service needs a different subset of dependencies? Would you like to make another virtual machine for specifically this case? Docker creates a separate namespace for each application and isolates the runtime environment, so each application can run on its own environment that has all dependencies it needs to use.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are going to see an overview of what Docker is and how to use it. Since there are usually multiple applications that need to be run for a business purpose (or during the development process), we will see Docker-compose which helps us to control multiple Docker containers conveniently. Let's begin!
  </p>

  <h2>1. Docker</h2>

  <h3>1.1. Installation</h3>

  <p>
    The installation process is a little bit complex even in a Linux system since there are some configurations for permissions. Since Docker uses the namespace nesting of Linux, it is Linux native by nature. It is possible to install Docker for Windows, you must use the Docker Enterprise version if you want to use Windows Server. Execute the following script to install Docker on Ubuntu or Debian machines. You can also follow step by step.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">
#!/bin/bash
# Install Docker CE in Ubuntu 18, and execute Docker commands without sudo.

# Install dependencies.
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y

# Get the GPG key.
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Add the Docker repository.
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"

# Install the Docker CE.
sudo apt update
apt-cache policy docker-ce
sudo apt install docker-ce -y

# Confirm the installation.
sudo systemctl status docker

# Add your user to the Docker group.
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

# Reboot or execute the following command to make it take effect.
su - ${USER}

# Confirm your use is in the Docker group.
id -nG

# Run the sample hello-world application.
docker run hello-world
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    The sample hello-world Docker image is interesting but doesn't highlight the infinite power of Docker containers. Hence, I'd like to introduce the most recent version of Eclipse, Che. Historically, IDEs are made as desktop applications since it's hard to run in other forms. For example, let's say we want to run an IDE as a server-client structured web app. We have to configure the network environment and infrastructure for the server, then we run the server. A client can simply be a browser, so open a browser and type the address. This is probably too much to do for private use. With a Docker container, it will be done by one line. Execute the following command.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">
docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v ~/Downloads:/data eclipse/che start
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    To get access to the service, click the following link to open up the browser.
  </p>

    <img src="img00.jpg" alt="Eclipse Che" width="100%">
    <figcaption>Eclipse Che</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    There could be numerous applications starting from portable workspaces, online collaboration, infrastructure support and integration, workspace snapshots, workflow automation with RESTful IDE control, DevOps integration for deployment automation, even code/pattern sharing database for automatic development. However, I am not talking about the advantages of a Cloud IDE, but about application packaging and automatic deployment. We are using a server-client application which would need complex configurations and installations of dependencies without doing so. This is just an example of one application but what if there are hundreds of computers we need to install multiple applications? This is all about automation and enhancing control.
  </p>

  <h3>1.2. Command Cheat Sheet</h3>

  <p>
    The following is output from the Docker command. It's important to grasp the high-level overview of commands rather memorizing individuals because you can always look up the details about commands. However, it is important to know what Docker can offer you to make the process more efficient and productive.

  <h2>3. Docker-Compose Demo</h2>

  <h3>3.1. Setup</h3>

  <p>
    We are going to see a demo to see the power of the automatic deployment with embedded configurations. Let's assume we are going to deploy a RESTful service with in-memory database (Redis) for 5 production servers. The back-end application will be in Python Flask. First, make a project folder.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">
mkdir composetest && cd composetest
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Next, write the source code for the Python Flask app.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-python"># app.py
import time

import redis
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)


def get_hit_count():
    retries = 5
    while True:
        try:
            return cache.incr('hits')
        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            if retries == 0:
                raise exc
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)


@app.route('/')
def hello():
    count = get_hit_count()
    return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Python apps need requirements.txt file to pick up dependencies.
  </p>


  <pre><code class="language-bash"># requirements.txt
flask
redis
  </code></pre>

  <h3>3.2. Dockerfile</h3>

  <p>
    Docker-compose is a composer for Docker containers, and each container can use a Dockerfile to be built on dependencies. Refer to the Docker documentation for writing Dockerfiles in detail.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash"># Dockerfile
# Starting from Python 3.7 image.
FROM python:3.7-alpine    
# Set the working directory to /code. 
WORKDIR /code    
# Set an environment variable.
ENV FLASK_APP app.py    
# Another environment variable.
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST 0.0.0.0    
# Install dependencies.
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev linux-headers    
# Copy the requirements file.
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt    
# Install Python dependencies.
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt    
# Copy the current directory . in the project to the workdir.
COPY . .    
# Execute the default command.
CMD ["flask", "run"]    
  </code></pre>

  <h3>3.3. Docker-Compose Yaml File</h3>

  <p>
    Finally, it's time to orchestrate all the containers in the docker-compose.yml file. The syntax is straight-forward; however, actual configurations could be complex depending on the host infrastructure. It is out-of-scope of this article to discuss networking and information system architecture, so we will be using a simple one.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-yaml"># docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
  </code></pre>

  <h3>3.4. Build and Run</h3>

  <p>
    We are ready to go, let's fire up the applications.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">
# Fire up all the dockers.
docker-compose up
# Test the RESTful service.
curl http://localhost:5000
# See all the images running.
docker image ls
# Take down all containers.
docker-compose down
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    If you repeatedly access the endpoint, the counter will be incremented by one, meaning the back-end app and Redis are working good!
  </p>

  <h3>3.5. Expand!</h3>

  <p>
    For this advanced demo, we will fire up 6 applications/services at the same time, namely, Redis, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Consul, and Jenkins. These applications are applications/services frequently used in the IT industry for various purposes. If there are multiple machines to deploy, you can use solutions like Jenkins to automate the service deployment. If you want to deploy and configure the applications above manually, it would take several hours if there are some dependencies in the architecture. However, see how simple it is by using Docker-compose.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-yaml"># docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  redis:
    image: "redis:latest"
    ports:
      - 6379:6379
  mongo:
    image: "mongo:latest"
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
  postgres:
    image: "postgres:latest"
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
  nginx:
    image: "nginx:latest"
    ports:
      - 80:80
  consul:
    image: "consul:latest"
    ports:
      - 8500:8500
  jenkins:
    image: "jenkins:latest"
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Let's check the applications and services are successfully running! You should use the exec command to execute a command in the namespace of each container. For web applications, you can get access to the services via a browser. Execute or click the followings:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash"># Redis

  <h2>0. Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    You won't be able to be satisfied if you want to deploy applications in an old way once you have experience with Docker containers. Especially if you are a developer, you would understand how it makes your life easier when the process could be automated by code. Usually, this needs a way to have standardized interfaces between systems and resources you need to manage. Docker took a smart move, elevating the Linux's namespace to the whole new next level to separate runtime environments. This type of virtualization truly shines when it's integrated with networking resources to form a cluster of machines.
  </p>

  <p>
    By using Docker containers and Docker-compose, one can manage application/service containers in a machine; however, it shouldn't really be a machine if the hardware resources can be virtualized and managed in a unified way. There are several solutions but Kunernetes is the most well-known one as well as Docker Swarm. With these solutions, containers can be deployed in a cluster and a cluster can be expanded with more machines or any hardware resources. It will be investigated to find possibilities of cluster computing and unified application/service/resource management.
