    <h1><b>Hello, Fuchsia!</b></h1>
    <p>
      An introduction of a new operating system developed by Google, which might be the next generation of a modern OS that will donimate a majority of computing devices of the future.
    </p>
    <p>2019/08/15</p>
  </div>

  <h2>0. Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    Fuchsia is an open-source capability-based operating system currently being developed by Google. In contrast to prior Google-developed operating systems such as Chrome OS and Android, which are based on the Linux kernel, Fuchsia is based on a new microkernel called Zircon, named after the mineral. It has been being developed for several years, and Google launched the official documentation page on July 1, 2019. 
  </p>

  <p>
    All the concerns and speculations -- Fuchsia will replace Android and Chrome OS or it is just one of the experiments Google does as a side project so it will die off soon  -- aside, it seems it aims to solve a very important problem for the age of networking "things". Usually, for embedded systems, Android is too big to implement because it is a monolithic kernel. The manufacturers have to make their own operating system from scratch, which could take a big investment and bring a lack of standard between manufacturers. If they can use an open-source micro-OS to only contain the minimal necessary functionalities, these systems could be integrated on a higher level, hence there would be a unified market for those devices.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This will undoubtedly ignite the second mobile revolution. By imbuing a networking and data-sharing capability into the objects surrounding us, we can better manage the objects and find values out of it. We could control all the objects in daily use. It will be like a magic lang where all objects have life accompanying intelligence that makes our lives so much easier and fancier. Hence, this Fuchsia project could be taking over the world in my opinion. It is worthy to follow the project in a long term.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a quick-start guild to get involved in the Fuchsia development. It will pick the most essential steps in the documentation and take you to be able to initiate, build, deploy, and modify the project. The Fuchsia project has awesome documentation (still evolving!) so visit the original documentation page for details.
  </p>

  <p>
    This guide will be focusing on working on a Ubuntu machine since Google officially uses some variant of a Debian OS. However, there shouldn't be any problems with other operating systems like Mac or Windows. As per the command differences, you can easily find all the corresponding commands in the official documentation.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Build & Boot</h2>

  <h3>1.1. Building from Source</h3>

  <h4>1.1.1. Prepare Build Environment</h4>

  <p>
    There are some packages required to compile the Fuchsia project. Execute the following command to get dependencies.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install build-essential curl git python unzip
  </code></pre>

  <h4>1.1.2. Golang Installation</h4>

  <p>
    The Fuchsia development requires Golang, follow the link and install the language compiler.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://golang.org/dl/">Golang Installation Instruction</a>
  </p>

  <h3>1.2. Fuchsia Source Code Management</h3>

  <h4>1.2.1. Check Out the Source</h4>

  <p>
    Execute the following script to download the source and setup the working folders automatically. It could take a while (tens of minutes or even hours). Before executing the script, make sure that Golang is installed and working properly on the system.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">curl -s "https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/master/scripts/bootstrap?format=TEXT" | base64 --decode | bash 
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    You can only choose one (either 1.2.2 or 1.2.3) to satisfy the environment variable installation for the Fuchsia toolchain. 
  </p>

  <h4>1.2.2. Setting Up Environment Variables</h4>

  <p>
    Upon success, the bootstrap script should print a message recommending that you add the .jiri_root/bin directory to your PATH. This will add jiri to your PATH, which is recommended and is assumed by other parts of the Fuchsia toolchain.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">export PATH="/home/user/fuchsia/.jiri_root/bin:$PATH"
  </code></pre>

  <p>If you chose this way, don't forget to add the same export command to /etc/profile.</p>

  <h4>1.2.3. Working without Altering Your PATH</h4>

  <p>
    If you don't like having to mangle your environment variables, and you want jiri to "just work" depending on your current working directory, just copy jiri into your PATH. However, you must have write access (without sudo) to the directory into which you copy jiri. If you don't, then jiri will not be able to keep itself up-to-date.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">cp .jiri_root/bin/jiri ~/bin 
  </code></pre>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">ln -s `pwd`/scripts/fx ~/bin 
  </code></pre>

  <h3>1.3. Build the OS</h3>

  <h4>1.3.1. Verify</h4>

  <p>
    If you added .jiri_root/bin to your path as part of getting the source code, the fx command should already be in your path. If not, the command is also available as scripts/fx. Type following command to see the fx command is ready to go.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">fx
  </code></pre>

  <h4>1.3.2. Build</h4>

  <p>
    Finally, we are ready! Initiate the build process with the following command. It will take a while.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">fx set core.x64 --with //bundles:kitchen_sink && fx build
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    The build products will be under the output directory as the option given (out/x64). The --with option means that we want to include the kitchen_sink bundle which represents everything. If you want to watch the changes and automatically build what has been changed, use the following watcher command.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">fx -i build
  </code></pre>

  <h3>1.4. Booting with QEMU</h3>

  <h4>1.4.1. Enabling Network</h4>

  <p>
    In order for ephemeral software to work in the emulator, an IPv6 network must be configured.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo ip tuntap add dev qemu mode tap user $USER && sudo ip link set qemu up 
  </code></pre>

  <h4>1.4.2. Boot Up & Explore</h4>

  <p>
    There are many customization options in the emulator. In order to see all the options, type following command.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">fx emu -h
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Execute the emulator with a network functionality enabled.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">fx emu -N
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Execute the development server, then you should see the emulator running.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">fx serve
  </code></pre>

  <h2>2. Hello Fuchsia!</h2>

  <h3>2.1. Development Guides</h3>

  <p>
    Getting involved in operating system development is a very fun and exciting process; However, there are important standards and conventions you need to know and follow to properly manage and maintain the project unless you'd fork from the existing to your own project. Still, conventional structures are the keys to control the source code in an organized way. 
  </p>

  <p>
    As I skim through the documentation, there were crucial pages hidden under other indexes; hence, I'd like to briefly introduce them for the readers and for myself since it's could be quite easy to miss out on those pages buried in others.
  </p>

  <h4>2.1.1. Source Code Layout</h4>

  <p>
    Managing a maintainable and scalable source code base starts with organizing a functional and unambiguous folder structure. Especially for a large project like Fuchsia, it's hard to begin to look for the part you want to modify if there is a well-formed structural convention:
  </p>

  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/source_code/layout.md">Fuchsia Project Source Code Layout</a>
  </p>

  <h4>2.1.2. Development Workflow</h4>
  
  <p>
    A workflow is a complete cycle from the inception of an idea to the deployment of the final product to a device. There are a few components or parts that can be developed and maintained, the following page shows a complete list:
  </p>

  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/workflows/package_update.md">Developing with Fuchsia Packages</a>
  </p>


  <h4>2.1.3. Debugging</h4>

  <p>
    Debugging is the only way to realize the problem into visible representations when things go wrong. Fuchsia has a debugger for native code (C++ and Rust) called zxdb, and it starts a program at boot called "crashanalyzer" that reports program crashes and prints a backtrace of the crashing thread.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/workflows/debugging">Debugging</a>
  </p>

  <h3>2.2. Hand-On Component Development: cowsay</h3>

  <h4>2.2.1. Source Code Modification</h4>

  <p>
    There are some programs in the /examples folder, we are going to modify one of the famous *nix programs called cowsay. Modify the code like the following and save.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="img03.jpg" alt="Modified Cowsay Program" width="80%">
    <figcaption>Modified Cowsay Program</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h4>2.2.2. Build & Push</h4>

  <p>
    It's very simple to build and push to the existing emulator.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">fx build-push cowsay
  </code></pre>

  <h4>2.2.3. Test</h4>

  <p>
    Finally, execute the program on the emulator, you should see the changes applied.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">cowsay
  </code></pre>

  <h2>0. Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    The first impression of Fuchsia is quite promising. I could be a little bit biased because I have seen so many successful projects associated with Google itself or ex-Googlers. However, I don't have any direct association with them. The Fuchsia's documentation was very clear, and the instructions were working like a charm without any barriers. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Google is a renowned company for experimenting with serious resources -- also known as amazingly reckless in a good sense. Therefore, it could be that Fuchsia is another experiment amongst them that had faded into history without putting its footprint in the people's minds. It has been for a while people trying to develop an operating system from scratch other than embedded hardware companies because they have no choice because of the size of the ROM in the devices they are dealing with. For bigger machines, it was a standard to use the Linux kernel and customize it for their own favor.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think the reason the Internet could revolutionize the world in almost every aspect was that it provided a way to do things in a standard way. The same could happen for the Internet of things, where all the machines communicate with each other with having a certain level of intelligence; however, we need a standard to make it happen. The answer could be Fuchsia, so should be followed and watched.
