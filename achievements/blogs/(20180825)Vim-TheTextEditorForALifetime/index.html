    <h1><b>Vim - The Text Editor for a Lifetime</b></h1>
    <p>
      An initial exploration of how I can use Vim to maximize the productivity of my workflow.
    </p>

  </div>

  <h2>0. Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    Too dramatic title? There are reasons for that. I have been using a computer for a long (relatively) time, and recently I got a wrist & shoulder arthritis. It's not a massive pain but a significant obstacle for my creativity and productivity. I have tried everything to make it better because this thing can't be cured by medication really. Keyboards, desktop setup, changing the hand I use the mouse, etc., and didn't really find a proper solution. The biggest problem is that my current way of doing things can't follow my thought/workflow. It wasn't a problem when I was a novice so I didn't have to type fast to make something. However, nowadays I am generating hundreds of lines of code, writing dozens of pages, searching thousands of pages a day. I am literally living in the cyberspace.
  </p>

  <p>
    Several years ago, I didn't understand why people are using GNU/Linux and all those command-line tools because I couldn't find value to use those difficult, user-unfriendly tools. At that time I didn't do programming, but only graphics, which required me to use most of GUI features. Nowadays I use at least five different languages, so I have put a lot of efforts to find a good IDE for the specific language. I am very picky to choose what IDE to use. It must be an open source project, nice plug-ins to a convenient expansion of the functionalities, auto-completion, Github integration, minimap, user-friendly debugging visualization, static code analysis, etc. The management has become a dire task to keep up.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the Youtube surfing, I happened to see a conference presentation about Vim. I have tried using Vim when I started to learn Linux, but I gave up because I felt I have to learn the editor first before starting learning programming. At that time, learning programming itself was a challenging task so I couldn't put any more challenges on the top of it. But now I feel I should find a solid editor to live with. Professionals and experts commonly recommend Vim and Emacs. I found both are very interesting and worthy to learn. Specially the Lisp language is the one I really wanted to learn, so I dream I use both eventually (Maybe in the Evil mode or similar).
  </p>

  <p>
    It seems like there is no satisfying article about how to learn Vim with minimum pain. Information is there on the Internet but all fragmented. Therefore I am writing this for me and others who want to migrate from the easy-world (Windows/IDEs/GUIs) to the wonderful geeky world (Linux/Emacs/Vim/Terminal). I will explain what is Vim editor with advantages and disadvantages, best learning resources, and the gradual migration strategy to make you comfortable to settle in.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Vim Text Editor</h2>

  <h3>1.1. What is Vim Editor</h3>

  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">
    Vim (/vÉªm/; a contraction of Vi IMproved) is a clone, with additions, of Bill Joy's vi text editor program for Unix. It was written by Bram Moolenaar based on the source for a port of the Stevie editor to the Amiga and first released publicly in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. - Wikipedia
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It has a deep, vast history and will be a 1000-pages book if someone describes all the details about it. The most important thing is that it has survived and is still widely used by many people. In a nutshell, it is a modal text editor with programmable capabilities. All atomic operations like moving the cursor or entering characters are made in a modular fashion, so it is possible to combine them to make a new behavior quickly and easily.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my opinion, this is a scripting language for text editing. The difference between Vi* and other scripting languages is Vi* uses keyboard input instead of strings of commands. People might say "Why the hack I should a scripting language to edit text?". This is a very valid point actually, so let's see some advantages.
  </p>

  <h3>1.2. Advantages</h3>

  <p>
    It is really hard to predict all the possibilities on what Vim can do, so I collected viable opinions from the Internet. Many of the opinions have something in common, and they are like the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fast and Light-Weighted with Small Memory Footprint</li>
    <li>Completely Free and Open Source</li>
    <li>Stable and Good for Editing Large Files</li>
    <li>Minimum Hands Movement during Editing</li>
    <li>Powerful Built-in Commands (Saves Key Strokes)</li>
    <li>Extreme Customization Possibilities</li>
    <li>Cross-Platforms (Linux, Mac, and Windows)</li>
    <li>Default Text Editor for Linux Machines</li>
    <li>Extensive Programming Support for Most of Languages</li>
    <li>Ready-Made Plug-ins for Expanding Functionalities</li>
    <li>Multiple Copy and Paste Buffers (Registers in a Vim's Term)</li>
    <li>Active Communities and Technical Support</li>
    <li>Fast and Reliable Remote Access (Or for Pair-Programming)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    All nice shiny things to have as a programmer, right? However, most of the convenience comes with a price. In fact, this is the biggest disadvantage of all, the price or cost you have to pay (sooner or later) for the functionalities.
  </p>

  <h3>1.3. Disadvantages</h3>

  <p>
    The followings are disadvantages or complaints well-known:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Anti-Intuitive Keybindings and Shortcuts</li>
    <li>Extremely Stiff Learning Curve</li>
    <li>Individual Preferences</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Vim (or Vi*, I will just call it Vim including all of the forks like NeoVim) is hard to learn. This is the main reason I haven't used it so far. But now, the motivation for productivity comes first, so I started learning. Earlier I said it is a scripting language right? Other scripting languages are sort of... intuitive because they are logical in nature. For example, you know the functionality of the "if" statement because it's... if statement. However, Vim ignores the logical sense of usage. Starting with the movement cursors, h, j, k, l. These keys are lined up straight, very different layouts from the standard "arrow" cursors. Because it is designed for optimized movement.
  </p>

  <p>
    However when you master it, you are editing the text at the maximum speed you can ever imagine. I just started using Vim (a week passed) and I already feel I am much more productive and don't feel the pain in my arms. This is a great motivation for me to keep me overcoming all the obstacles for the learning process. But still, the learning curve is unbelievable. See the graph below.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="img00.jpg" alt="Vim's Learning Curve Comparison" width="100%">
    <figcaption>Vim's Learning Curve Comparison</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Even people who have been using Vim for decades say they only know like 10% about it. But I think their productivity already exceeds that of the others who don't use it. Some people say programming is not about typing but thinking and etc. That's correct if you only make simple programs without documentation. If you see some code of popular frameworks, often the code is 10 lines but documentation of the code is 300 lines. It is not close to the reality to say programming is not typing even though it is conceptually correct.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, it wouldn't really hurt anyone to learn Vim, or try to improve productivity in text editing in a similar manner. I performed a search to find the best learning materials that would make you learn without much pain (some pain is unavoidable though).
  </p>

  <h2>2. Best Learning Resources</h2>

  <h3>2.1. Tutorials</h3>

  <p>
    The followings are learning resources. I personally recommend starting with games or interactive tutorials. Then watch some videos and try out some techniques. Finally, for more detailed documentation, visit web pages and articles.

  </ul>

  <h3>2.2. Challenges</h3>

  <p>
    In Vim, the objective (for the text editor of course) is to minimize the keystrokes for the same job. If you want to improve how you use Vim, visit VimGolf and try to get a high score! It is very nice to see how others do the same task and learn from it.

  <h3>2.3. Communities</h3>

  <p>
    Vim communities are active and can give technical support when you are stuck in certain situations. The followings are Vim communities you can explore:
  </p>

  <h3>2.4. Cheatsheets</h3>

  <p>
    Cheatsheets are one of the most convenient ways to quickly skim through the available commands when you are curious about what to use for a specific task. Some are lists and others are graphical, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. I recommend to print out one of each and put that on the wall near your computer.

  <h2>3. Migration Strategy</h2>

  <p>
    So this is the most valuable part of this article. I couldn't find a single subject on the Internet about how to start using Vim as a "pre-existing person" other than a baby who can use Vim without any prejudice. What I mean by that is most of us who want to use Vim are the people who are already so much attached to the existing technologies. It is simply not possible to change our primary text editor or IDE to Vim on a single day. I have read many people switched to Vim and couldn't use it because they had to give up too many things they were capable with the editors/IDEs they had been using before. Especially in a production environment, if you are a person who customized for your daily needs, your IDE is already too much customized and the moment you change it, you will lose it. You can't risk your job like that right?
  </p>

  <p>
    What we need is a good transition/migration plan or strategy. In this way, we don't have to give up everything at a single moment, but we can divide and manage risks in a modular manner (like Vim!). In the worst case you find out you are not a "Vim" person, you can simply go back to the original. Or if you really like your current IDE, you can just stay in the middle (I will explain it later). Let's see what options we have.
  </p>

  <h3>3.1. Virtual Machines</h3>

  <p>
    If you are ready to use the hardcore command-line Vim right away, I recommend using a virtual machine to isolate the environment first. Usually we use Git for the development so moving data is not a problem. The code is always on the Cloud, then you are just editing it from the remote machine. Vim has a philosophy like that of *nix systems, so the seamless integration with the OS can be done when the OS is *nix systems. With a virtual machine, even Windows users can try out the OS and Vim at the same time. If you like Vim, chances are very high you would like Linux.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2. IDEs</h3>

  <p>
    Regardless of what OS you are using, you use IDEs for programming like me. I found it is the best for me to use Vim mode in those IDEs for now without sacrificing what I can do now with those IDEs. Also I was very surprised that almost all IDEs I am using support Vim mode. The followings are IDEs that support Vim mode:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus">Github Atom</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim">JetBrains IDEA</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://kate-editor.org/kate-vi-mode/">Kate's KDevelop</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php/Vim_emulator_plugin">Code-Blocks</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.rstudio.com/tags/vim">RStudio</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JaredParMSFT.VsVim">Microsoft Visual Studio</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk">Microsoft Office Word</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/seanyeh/vibreoffice">LibreOffice Writer</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim">Apple XCode</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/home/">Eclipse</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/2802/jvi-vi-vim-editor-clone">Netbeans</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some IDEs like JetBrains' support the Vim mode from the manufacturer so you don't have to look for the 3rd party plug-in. Usually these have better performance. One thing you should remember is Vim mode plug-ins are not Vim itself. Sometimes it doesn't support all functionalities Vim has. However, it's undeniable that Vim mode is a good way to learn and prepare the complete migration to Vim.

  <h2>4. (Bonus)Web Searching with Vimium</h2>

  <p>
    This is for the people who don't want to use a mouse for daily tasks. For me, using a mouse simply hurts my arms. Also it is very slow and cumbersome. Thankfully, there is a Chrome plug-in (extension) that enables to surf the web with a keyboard. It's not 100% perfect, but it significantly saves time. Try it!
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://vimium.github.io/">Vimium</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The following table is Vimium's keybindings. Only thing I had a problem is the 'u' key. In Vim, 'u' key is for "undo". In Vimium, 'u' key is for scrolling the page upwards. Keep that in mind when you switch from the Vimium to the real Vim.
  </p>

  <h2>0. Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    I am not a serious Vim user (yet). It has been only a week, and usually I use Vim mode in other IDEs. I plan to migrate to it as soon as I can replace all goodies in IDEs with the Vim plug-ins. I am very excited about the fact that I can improve productivity drastically without physical solutions. Also I am in a transition from Windows to Linux, the only obstacle is my school I am attending now since they are so oriented to use MS technologies. I have been preparing the OS migration and it has been almost a year. I think I am ready and will completely change the main OS as I graduate. I don't know whether this is a good decision (OS or Vim) or not since I have never tried before.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a beginning of my personal journey, but I will keep posting the progress for the people who want to see what happens if you get out of the proprietary world to FOSS world. Please mail me if you have opinions or suggestion.
