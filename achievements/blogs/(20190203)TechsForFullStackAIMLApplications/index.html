  <h2>0. Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    Machine learning theories with graphs and data points look good on the whiteboard. Code snippets that process the Pandas data frame could be useful for building bigger projects or upload it to the online Jupyter Notebook. However, nothing would be more powerful than showing graphics and controllable interfaces that represent the learning process in a visual format. This is why you might consider making a full-stack artificial intelligence and machine learning application for your idea.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yes, it is my story. I have been making theoretical presentations and code snippets processing tables; however, I have been longing for having an ability to make a full stack application composed of a data processing unit, a learning part, database storage, and a view for users. The problem is there are too many choices for each part. This article is an answer to the question that asks what technology stacks are the most capable and convenient.

  <p>
    I don't think there is just one answer of course. However, I have tried many technologies and got some insights to share. It was not a simple task to learn each technology and find out advantages and disadvantages. As of now, I strongly feel I can settle down from a year-long journey, so I wanted to share this with people who might have the same use case. Let's begin!
  </p>

  <h2>1. Checklist</h2>

  <h3>1.1. Opensource / Community / Longevity</h3>

  <p>
    Longevity of a technology is the most important factor when you choose a technology to invest your time. Nobody wants the technology they have invested a significant amount of time to disappear or decline. Statistically and empirically speaking, the opensource technologies live longer than the proprietary technologies. Opensource technologies don't have pricing plans, which generally lowers the entrance barrier for the users, which leads to a bigger community, which increases the popularity of the technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    Furthermore, the technology I would like to be involved in must be hackable. Many proprietary technologies designate prevention of reverse engineering in their license. For example, it is not legal to reverse engineer to find out the mechanism or algorithm of Windows OS. If there is an error in the system level, most likely they wouldn't disclose the exact origin of the problem. Instead, you will have to send an error report and wait for the engineers to solve the problem. In my personal opinion, the operating systems nowadays are pretty stable -- compared to the cutting-edge technologies -- so most of the time it is okay -- however, I saw a blue screen yesterday.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, there are lots of bugs and imperfections in the cutting-edge technologies because it is rapidly being developed. If users can't touch the codebase, first the amount of time for the bugfix will increase, and second, there is no way to implement satellite functions by enthusiastic contributors.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>
    Computer languages are the basis of IT technologies. Hence, at this point, it is possible to exclude some technologies based on some popular proprietary languages such as Java, Visual Basic .NET, C#, and Objective-C. Don't get me wrong. I think Java is one of the most elegant languages in the world. I'd like to use Java if I am a business owner and want to develop a computer system that requires stability, extensibility, and performance. However, as the reasons stated above, I wouldn't choose it for a full stack AIML application.
  </p>

  <h3>1.2. High Level Interfaces / Rapid Prototyping</h3>

  <p>
    Don't invent the wheel again. Well, sometimes you have to make a wheel because all existing wheels don't satisfy your needs. For example, if I want to develop a machine learning application for an embedded device, probably I will have to use C to program and have to write Pandas in C from scratch. However, most cases I want to test my ideas and it requires diverse sets of toolbox ready to be used.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of you may already notice, yes, I am excluding C and C++. Even though I am an enthusiastic memory manager, I don't want to deal with memory problems when I need to make so many trials and errors on my ideas. It is just a different point of view. Also it is worthy to mention that some GUI frameworks like GTK+ or MFC (Yes it is very old technology but some people are still using it) will be eliminated from the list.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, we have only two languages on the list. Javascript and Python. Both are opensource and high-level languages with a huge community that maintains diverse frameworks and libraries. Now it is time to examine some more detailed technologies based on those two languages.
  </p>

  <h3>1.3. Cross Platform / Universality</h3>

  <p>
    Universality is the most important factor from a business perspective. How many users can get access to my application without putting a significant amount of efforts? Nowadays people are so accustomed to instantaneity. They click something and if it is not working right away they will give up and move on. Even installing a program is considered too much unless it is very attractive software like a popular game.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are many GUI frameworks but both language but would there be a better choice than using Javascript to build UIs? Because Javascript is a language invented to build web UIs. In the past, there was no HTML canvas so it's not possible to make a graphic object in the browser. However, nowadays there are so many games using HTML canvas to display vector graphics.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we choose Javascript to build UIs, we can solve two problems at the same time. First, almost all end-user devices (desktop, laptops, tablets, and smart phones) have a web browser. So we don't need to worry about accessibility. Second, there is no need to install the application because it will be deployed following the web protocol. Web technologies and Javascript will be the standard of the web for a long time, so no worries to follow disorganized development environments from multiple companies. One downside is that this application must be a server-client structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, the server-client structure can be an advantage too since it is a modular approach, and very convenient to expand the scope. This is called the micro-service architecture. All functional units are in a distributed environment, and they are communicating via standard protocols (HTTP, TCP/IP). If you want to add one more functional unit, it is totally independent of other functional units. It means the developer only needs to know the API specification and it is good for a big collaborative environment since each department can develop each part and combine it later.
  </p>

  <p>
    This advantage gives me an opportunity to assemble and disassemble the functionality units without changing the code structure of the application as well as to share a functional unit with others. As I said above, other developers only need to know the APIs, not the internal of the application.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now we need to choose the server technology. Javascript has a very good server-side solution, which is node.js. Python has two options which are DJango and Flask. All of these frameworks are wonderful, but I will give Python's DJango and Flask higher scores because there are countless libraries for AI/ML development. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/top-20-python-ai-and-machine-learning-open-source-projects/">Click here to see the most popular of them</a>
  </p>

  <h2>2. The Winner</h2>

  <h3>2.1. Front-End</h3>

  <p>
    I would choose Vue.js for the front-end Javascript framework, but there are many alternatives (React, Angular, Meteor.js) If you need a CSS library, pick one from the most popular one (Bootstrap, Materialize, Bulma, etc.) These frameworks work in a very similar way, so if you get yourself familiarized with one, it is much easier to use others.
  </p>

  <h4>2.2. Back-End</h4>

  <p>
    Python DJango would be good if you need a complete set of tools, and choose Flask if you just need a simple function like Restful API backend. DJango has its own template engine so you can use that instead of one of the front-end frameworks above. If you need a websocket for real-time communication with the front-end, use Python Channel. In the next section, we will make a barebone base structure that prepares the fundamental development boilerplate for a full stack AI/ML application.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Prototype</h2>

  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/demikaiser/FullStackAIMLAppTemplate">AIML Template GitHub Repository</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    If the GitHub repository is not working in any reasons, download it from 
    <a target="_blank" href="./FullStackAIMLAppTemplate-master.zip">AIML Template Local Storage</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>3.1. Front-End</h3>

  <p>
    Vue.js is used for the front-end. See App.vue and HelloWorld.vue for the basic setup.
  </p>

  <h4>3.2. Back-End</h4>

  <p>
    Python Flask is used for the back-end. See main.py and aiml.py for the basic setup.
  </p>

  <h2>0. Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    We have investigated the best (somewhat personal) practice for multi-purposes artificial intelligence and machine learning full stack applications. The entire industry is heading towards the software development process that makes manageable micro-services to incorporate the concept of OOP at a very high level (Operations). 
  </p>

  <p>
    Furthermore, it makes a perfect sense that AIML applications have fancy GUI interfaces rather than CLI text output. Since there is no strong cohesion between the front-end and the back-end, each part can be replaced by an alternative. For example, if the system extensively uses Java Spring for the back-end services, only the back-end can be replaced by it. Also it is possible to replace a part of the back-end functionality as far as each service uses a standardized interface like Restful.
